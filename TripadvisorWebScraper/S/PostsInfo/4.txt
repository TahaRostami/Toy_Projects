Will do, Kevin. Luxury Escapes have warned it might take some time to reply to my query due to the number of inquiries people are making. Cheers

Singapore Airlines have cancelled some of their flights to and from the USA, however l got an email from them yesterday telling me of their huge infrastructure that they have put in place to keep passengers safe, pleased to see they are scrubbing down all aircraft beforehand, keeping passengers in safe areas in transit and everyone gets screened on arrival in Singapore. Luckily SA doesnt have a single case of the virus and people are going on holiday as normal, hope someone doesnt come back with the virus.

Bali is safe, at least is for China Tourists who will stay longer in Bali, Indonesia.



For the second time Indonesian Government has given Special Visa to almost 1,000 China Tourists who will extent to stay longer in Indonesia for the next 30 days. One month ago more than 1,200 China Tourists apply for Special Visa and all has been given.



Previously there are a plane want to pickup China Tourists from Bali. But only about 80 persons do it. The plane is very empty, because the capacity of the plane is about 300 passengers.

Post 33, please be honest in your posts. You know that Bali is at risk as much as anyhere else in the world. What we all need to weigh up is mass infection, and the capability of a country's infrastructure to cope with this.

Singapore Airlines, as great as they are, cannot control the virus or it's spread. It's no secret that Asian based airlines have had many cancellations, so all are doing their best to try to reasure existing passengers while simultaneously attempting to minimise substantial financial losses. If you want an example of what it really takes to disinfect a large aircraft, have a look at what Qantas did recently after they collected Aussies from China. Compare the two and then rethink just how effective SIA's measures will actually be. 

Cheers

From the Financial Times this morning: 

Headline - "Bali doctor: if there is a coronavirus patient, I'll be infected"



Medical workers have warned that the Indonesian holiday island of Bali is severely underprepared to deal with the deadly coronavirus, threatening its 4m inhabitants and a tourist industry worth billions of dollars each year.



Interviews with staff at the three Bali hospitals earmarked to treat victims of a virus that has infected more than 80,000 people around the world point to a lack of equipment, staff and infrastructure required to deal with an outbreak.



Im not convinced, Ni Ketut Pande Sri Widnyani, senior doctor at Sanjiwani Gianyar hospital, one of the facilities, said of Balis ability to handle such a crisis. Right now were not up to the required standard, she said of the hospital. Theres a lack of facilities andI pray we wont be infected.



Indonesia, the worlds fourth-most populous country, has yet to report a single confirmed case of the coronavirus despite its strong economic ties with the rest of Asia and especially China where the illness originated. Given that the virus has quickly spread to almost 40 countries, international experts question whether this is credible.



The fact that Indonesia has not reported any cases is highly unusual, said Ian Mackay, a virologist at Queensland University in Australia, noting that Bali was a top destinations for travellers from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. In a major destination for visitors from China we would expect to see infected patients.



Bali is considered particularly exposed to a virus outbreak because of its popularity with mainland Chinese who accounted for 1.2m of its more than 6m international visitors last year.



After China declared the outbreak in January some of these tourists extended their stay in Bali rather than going home. A large number of Indonesians also work in China, often as domestic helpers...

Hi guys! My fam (husband and 1 and 3 year old) are due to go to Bali with a Luxury Escapes deal on the 14th March. I called luxury escapes, long hold time, and was advised its at the hotels discretion if they allow us to change dates as we are inside of the 45 day allowable period. Luxury Escapes contacted our hotel, ccing me, and the hotel have said that while Bali is safe, they will allow me to rebook up until Dec this year. Tail watching and waiting, but I think Ill change our dates to go later in the year.
