That is true, they cooperation with Kobe University and have found the reagent for identify Covid-19. For common all Corona virus, Indonesia has do testing more than ten years. If positive, so the sample will be tested in Jakarta for assay, so will know what kinds of Corona Virus, needs about 2 days for it. With reagent needs only hours.

Until nowadays there are no Covid-19 positive patient in Indonesia.



There are one Indonesia citizen got Covid-19 positive in Singapore and 4 of Indonesian citizens got Covid-19 positive in Diamond Princess Cruise Ship as crews from 78 Indonesian crews means about 5 percent. But more than a fourth or more than 25 percent of the 1,700 passengers got Covid-19 positive, means high risk to use cruise ship. Most of the passengers are old persons, whereas most of the crew are young persons. So, if you are healthy and still young, you are more safe than if you are old person.

Thank you for the reassurance Sarwa. Its promising to know that people returning to Australia from Indonesia are free from the virus, thats a positive. I will be traveling via Singapore next month and plan to avoid contact with people as much as possible. We dont have a single case of the virus in SA so it is definitely possible not to have it and l really dont think anyone is hiding something.

You must take safe action outside Indonesia and outside SA, because 2 positive Covid-19 patients has been found in Iran. Until nowadays Africa is still safe.

Follow-up to my previous comments - just to let you know came back from Bali last Thursday evening after 10 days unscathed except for damn mozzie bites from being at the Villa - take your Aeroguard or similar. If you want to feel safe on the plane and airport then get your family the right masks but it's the hand sanitising which is more important (as it should be anyway). 



I was the only one that I saw wear one on way up in plane and didn't worry on way home - not many people even in streets etc wearing them there.



Read up on the Virus symptoms and how to catch it. I read it was only 4-5 hours window and mainly from surfaces and then you touch your facial orefaces and bam you MAY get it, so just watch the public things.



I only saw one young woman in Matahari with a head cold and she is the one who should have had a mask on.



Only person on my home plane trip who had a mask on was an elderly lady and me being 67 not much older than myself. 



The local are feeling the pinch from people cancelling and are struggling again. The Hotel where I stayed initially - The Green Garden - said it was quieter than usual and same with drivers and taxis I used while there.



So go and spend lots of money as their economy needs it too. 



I also heard Singapore is very quiet on the streets too so all this drama is having an effect everywhere.



Enjoy your time with family and if you feeling uncomfortable around someone coughing and spluttering (which may only be a cold) just do normal cautions.



ENJOY!

PS sorry - stayed in a Villa in Jimbaran Village area and wasn't really in a lot of Public places often like general shopping malls etc so your isolation there may be okay. 



Just buy some Glen 20 or similar when you get there and wipe things down that bubs may touch or lick just as a precaution.

Im here at the moment with 2 kids. There were a few people at the airport wearing masks, but thats it. I have no concerns about Coronavirus over here. Id be more worried about the transit through Thailand - Id wear a mask there. We brought P2 masks over with us (we needed them at home with the bushfires) but havent felt the need to wear them in Bali.

I agree with Dipen N. So far no announcements have been made about coronavirus cases in Indonesia, but probably it is a just a matter of time. It's starting to spread globally now and Indonesia is one of the only countries in Asia not to have announced any cases despite there being a lot of contact with China and lots of Chinese visitors. 



Unfortunately it seems many people are more concerned about being quarantined than about having the virus.



Anyway, it sounds fine to visit Bali for now, just bring good quality face masks just in case (they will sell out almost immediately if any case is confirmed) and bring plenty of hand sanitizer.
