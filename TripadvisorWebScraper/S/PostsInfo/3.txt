The one thing to be aware of is does your travel insurance cover you? Otherwise go for it!

One thing to be aware of is that most travel insurances exclude pandemics from coverage so if WHO does declare Covid-19 a pandemic, it will not cover any coronavirus-related expenses.

Further to Robins post (# 22), I checked with our insurance company, Insure & Go, this morning for our trip later in May. 



They advised that well be covered if the Australian Government issues a Do Not Travel advisory. Otherwise, theres no other cover. Fingers crossed that it doesnt come to that and this somehow settles down. Cheers

Hi Baileybum , I am travelling to Bali in May and my travel insurance provider has issued a blanket "No" any pandemic/epidemic.



Can you please confirm that your insurance provider will only cover you if the Australian government issues a "Not Safe To Travel " warning. 



I thought that warning would have negated any form of travel insurance.

Hi Limited Edition, thats right. Were only covered by a Not Safe to Travel warning. No mention of pandemics whatsoever. Im going to contact Luxury Escapes (who we booked through) to ascertain their position on this as well. 

Cheers

Hi Baileybum , That is an interesting clause. A few TA members are fortunately covered by Insurers such as TID and Southern Cross.1 Cover werent that compliant.



Goodluck with enquiries!!..Safe Travels

BailyBum, can you please post the reply you get from Luxury Escapes, please, as we are booked through them for an 8 night Bali stay in June, and I am getting a bit concerned. We have one chance to change accommodation bookings outside of 45 days before check-in.

Me too - but we are more concerned about being in an aircraft and airports than in Bali coming from Oz. I'll be masking up I think.
