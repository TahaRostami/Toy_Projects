Hi my family and I are booked to travel to Bali via Thailand on the 13th of March. I will be travelling with my parents and my young children (1 & 7). I was wondering if it was safe to go to Bali at this time and whether there being zero reported Corona Virus cases was true for Bali?



The company that I have booked my villa through have been following up with me for my balance payment and assure me that Bali is safe but it would be great to hear from other travellers that are planning to visit or already there.



Thanks in advance.

Hello Vishal,

If you believe the latest statistics being 3 cases in India, 35 cases in Thailand and 

still none in Bali. You are safer in Bali than anywhere else. Im in Bali atm and life is as normal here.

Hi Glenn,



Thanks for your response. For me it was a bigger concern when I read that Bali/Indonesia has zero cases as the virus has reached parts of Europe as well which is much further away - is it really true? Some say that its because they dont have test kits over there, others say its being hidden so it doesnt hit tourism...



I hope you have a safe trip in Bali and do share some updates if you hear anything.



Thanks again

It is very much a personal decision as to whether to cancel or proceed with travel plans. Perhaps you could consider that statistically there is a much higher percentage of risk of catching various diseases and/or being involved in a nasty traffic accident both in your home city or anywhere else in the world.

When SARS happened, Indonesia was zero SARS patient and nowadays also zero positive Covid-19 patient.



Every year there are 1.4 million people go to Middle East for Umroh, Haj or working there, so Indonesia is always aware of Corona Virus such as MERS. Indonesia is also aware of Bird Flu virus of migrant birds from north and south hemisphere, however Bird Flu virus is different with Corona Virus. So, Indonesia can easily detect the viruses, if any.

There are about 50 Covid-19 suspect patients. Even who get common cold is checked and all of them are negative of Covid-19.

LeeLou, have a look at the other threads on this subject - there's been much debate about just that. So far, I've not read any details of what kinds of tests are being used, their accuracy and under what criteria they are being applied. 

The thing that does reassure me is, as LimitedEdition points out, there don't seem to be any people reporting symptoms coming home from Bali.
